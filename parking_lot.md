# Parking Lot

##### Description

The information in this markdown is intended to expand on your questions we were not able to cover during lecture periods. It will also include best practices on how to approach programming. 

##### Lecture Parking Lot

* Using `-i` to run your file. If you have a python file that you normally run with `python3 file.py` you can use `-i` with it. This will open the interactive pyton3 repl with your file. Below is an example where I made a file with a function to print a string. I do not invoke that function inside of the file

```
//inside your terminal make a python file
touch hello.py

//inside hello.py

def hello():
	print("HELLO WORLD")
	
//Do not invoke it
//Back inside of your terminal

python3 -i hello.py

>>> hello()
>>> 'HELLO WORLD'
```

##### Jason's Best Practices

* `Version Control` - Always push working code to github. Do not wait until you have "completed" the exercise. Version Control is meant to SAVE your progress. You wouldn't write a novel on microsoft word and only save it when the novel is done. 
* `Pseudo Code` - Think about your application before you start to code anything. Pseudo code what your objects will look like. Also make sure to write as many user stories as possible, and build out a detailed ERD if you are utilizing a database
* `DO NOT copy old code from a previous assignment.` If you want to use an old assignment for reference that's fine, but type out EVERYTHING. Repeat, Practice, Memorize.
* `DO NOT use code you don't understand.` If you decide to copy something you found through your research such as Stack Overflow answers, make sure you understand every letter of that code before using it. 
* `Doc Strings` - Use doc strings to comment out your code. They can also be viewed in the terminal when you `dir()` and `help()` your file. Doc strings can also be used to type out formatted print statements so there's no need to use string commands such as `\n`
