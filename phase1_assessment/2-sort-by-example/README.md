# Sort By Example
===

* Given an Array and an Example-Array to sort to, write a function that sorts the Array following the Example-Array.
* Assume Example Array catalogs all elements possibly seen in the input Array.
* However, the input Array does not necessarily have to have all elements seen in the Example.
* Example:

```
arr = [1,3,4,4,4,4,5]
example_arr = [4,1,2,3,5]

print(exampleSort(arr, example_arr))


Result: [4,4,4,4,1,3,5]
```
