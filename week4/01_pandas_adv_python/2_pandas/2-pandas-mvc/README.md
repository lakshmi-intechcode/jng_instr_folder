NYC Police Complaints MVC
=========================

##### Part 1

* Build a DataFrame from a New York City open data set, "Complaints per Uniformed Officer". 
* Use Pandas library methods to find the answer to questions in `QUESTIONS.md`.

##### Part 2

Write an MVC application to present analysed data to a user.

* We'll be reading NYC police complaint data into a Pandas DataFrame from a CSV.

A user should be able to:

* see the five precinct / years with the most complaints
* see the five precinct / years with the least complaints
* see the average number of complaints
* see the total number of complaints

### BONUS

A user can:

* see the total number of complaints by precint / command
* see which year had the most total complaints
* see which year had the least total complaints

*hint:* We didn't use `.head()` and `.tail` in the last exercise. They
may be useful here.
