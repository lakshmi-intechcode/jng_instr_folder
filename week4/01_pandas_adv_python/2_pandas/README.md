================

* Today you'll get some time to dive into the `pandas` library
* Their documentation is here: [http://pandas.pydata.org/](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
* Check out the section titled "10 Minutes to Pandas" Here
	* [http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/10min.html](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/10min.html)

##### Series and Data Frame

* `Series` and `DataFrame` are the names Pandas gives to one-dimensional
and two-dimensional sets of data. 
* Pandas provides a shockingly simple method to achieve this:
`.read_csv()`.
* With Pandas, it's always best (fastest) to use a pandas library
method, rather than iterating through the data yourself.
