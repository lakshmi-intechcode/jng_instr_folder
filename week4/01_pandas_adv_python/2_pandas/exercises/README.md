Pandas and more MVC
===================

Today we finally use [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/). Pandas is a
best-in-class *data analysis* library written in Python.

`sudo pip3 install pandas`

# Pair Programming
"Pair programming" can be loosely defined as "working together". Today
we'll be pair programming. You can read about some of the [benefits of
pair programming](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PairProgrammingBenefits) at
c2 -- the *original* wiki!

Everything from that discussion is true, but the real motive is to
force clarity in your thinking by having you communicate your
ideas and solutions to another person.

# YAMVC (Yet Another Model View Controller)
We're also building another MVC application.

MVC is important because:
* In one form or another, model-view-controller is a nigh-universal
  design paradigm used to build user interfaces.
* This exercise utilizes many elements of the toolkit you've acquired
  so far:
  * `if __name__ == "__main__":`
  * `class`, `self`, and Object Oriented Programming
  * `import`
  *  SQL
  * keeping your code in a working state
* You have to write more code than you've ever written.
