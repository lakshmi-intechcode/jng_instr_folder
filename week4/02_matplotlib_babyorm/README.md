MatPlotLib and babyORM
======================

This README will change.

The first exercise should be something you already know: build SQL
tables modeling Many-to-One and Many-to-Many relationships. Do it
first; it's there so I can be sure you're ready for the assessment.

The second exercise utilizes MatPlotLib to build graphs from data
using Pandas. Like yesterday's Pandas exercises, you'll find it easier
than you predicted.

Later today I'll introduce babyORM, which will be your greatest
challenge yet, involving many new concepts that fall into the
category of "Advanced Python".

Your ticket pays for the whole seat but you only need the edge...
