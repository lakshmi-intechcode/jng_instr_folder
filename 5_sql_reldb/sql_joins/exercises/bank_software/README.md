## Your Own Private Bank

* Welcome back! In this challenge you'll be creating a rich Python terminal app emulating bank software. Make sure to READ EVERYTHING in this markdown before you start coding

##### Objective 1 - Database

* Draw out your ERD!
* We will have two tables: Users and Accounts
* A user can have many accounts
* Users should have
	* A username to log in
	* A password to log in
	* When they were initially created
	* A permission level
* Accounts should have
	* A number
	* A balance
* Use a createdb file and a seed file to help yourself get started

##### Objective 2 - Models

* Create two separate classes: Users as clients and Users and a banker
* A client should be able to:
	* view all their accounts
	* deposit and withdraw from their own account
	* transfer money from one account to another user account
* A banker should be able to:
	* create accounts
	* deposit and withdraw from any user account
	* transfer money between two accounts
* Note
	* A client cannot see the options a banker has
	* A banker cannot have any account associated with them
* Extra
	* Think about organizing it further and having an extra class that will handle only the reading and writing to the database

##### Objective 3 - The Rest of the MVC

* Make sure to follow the MVC pattern to organize your code.
