###Teaching Tips from Byte Instructors

([Jeff](http://jeffmaxim.herokuapp.com/)) Use the [Jisaw Classroom](https://www.jigsaw.org) strategy. This will help students get to know eachother better on day 1 and help them get in a habit of reaching out to their classmates for help.

###In-Class Demonstration Ideas

Write the code snippet on the white board:
```
x = 0
for i in range(10):
    x += 1
```
Get an empty bowl. Explain that `x = 0` is declaring an empty storage container called `x` just like the bowl is an empty storage container. Explain that `x += 1` is like adding items to the bowl. Have some small item, like `m&m's`, and add them to the bowl to demonstrate.



###Thought Questions

Why do we need variables? What would happen to our programs if we couldn't use variables.
Specific example: How would we write a program that adds two numbers together if we didn't have access variables?

# Teaching Notes

### Making a Lesson Plan

##### Learning Objectives

* Learning Objectives are items that can be measured/demonstrated
* We `DO NOT` use subjective crap such as:
	* `students will understand`
	* `students will learn`
* LO's can be shown:
	* `Students will be able to draw out an ERD using schema designer`
	* `Students will be able to utilize a for loop and a while loop`

##### Context

* Why are we learning this? 
* Why is this important?
* What is the purpose of todays lesson?
* Example:
	* `We are learning about file I/O because it is an introduction to passing data back and forth between files. All of programming revolves around passing data to and from different places.`

##### Lessons

* Break up your lessons into different parts
* Make sure these parts `scaffold` one on top of the other
* Try to input very light "Five Minute Exercises" throughout your lessons
* This will help to keep students engaged and paying attention to the lesson at hand
* Utilize the `I do, You do` style of teaching

### Teaching Practices

* Engagement / Checks for Understanding
	* Work together on the white board
	* Fist of Five
	* Cupcakes / Bananas
* Never talk for an hour or more straight without having some form of activity / break in between
* Stay on track of the lesson plan. Do not go off topic. If a student ask a question that does not relate to the Learning Objectives shut it down (respectfully)
	* You can utilize a `Parking Lot` for this
		* Make a markdown and fill it with questions from the classroom that you did not know the answer to or did not want the answer to.
		* Example:
			* "Why doesn't this work with blah blah"
			* "Thats a great question, let's parking lot that for now so we can stay on task. I'll put something in the parking lot later today about it."
