# MOAR UNIX!!!

* We can save variables in our shell

```
$ a = hello
$ b = world
$ echo $a
$ echo $b
```
* Save a variable b to a .txt file
* Take the contents of the file and tweet it
* Write a script that creates five files and writes each consecutive line to it's respective file.
* Make a sixth file. have it write all the lines with the word "sculpture", and how many times the word appears. 
* You can make the files .txt, and name them whatever you want
* You should not be naming them manually, your script should built them for you. 
* If I gave you a 100 line text file, it would make 100 folders with .txt files in them, and one file with all the ines that contain the word "sculpture", and the word count
* You will find the [subprocess](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html) module helpful for this assignment. What does the shell parameter do?
