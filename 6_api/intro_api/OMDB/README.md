# Your Movie Database

##### Description

* Today you learned about apis. Now we're going to utilize a free non-key movie database. 
* Since IMDB does not have a free or open API, there is a service called "OMDB" which takes the data from IMDB and opens it to the public, well most of it anyway. 

##### Objective

* Build a terminal application utilizing the MVC pattern
* MVP:
	* A user should be able to search for a movie by title
	* If multiple movies appear then a list should populate with the title and year
	* A user should be able to choose which one from the list to view
	* When a single movie is populated it should show the title, year, director, cast, and plot
