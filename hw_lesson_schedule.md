##### Wednesday

* OMDB API

##### 

* Use OMDB API

* This wrapper will be imported to a models file
* The model will hold methods which will take in user input and pass that parameter to the wrapper file to make the request
* Once that is done build out a MVC application where the user can search a movie and the movie information will populate onto the terminal
