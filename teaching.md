# Teaching Notes

### Making a Lesson Plan

##### Learning Objectives

* Learning Objectives are items that can be measured/demonstrated
* We `DO NOT` use subjective crap such as:
	* `students will understand`
	* `students will learn`
* LO's can be shown:
	* `Students will be able to draw out an ERD using schema designer`
	* `Students will be able to utilize a for loop and a while loop`

##### Context

* Why are we learning this? 
* Why is this important?
* What is the purpose of todays lesson?
* Example:
	* `We are learning about file I/O because it is an introduction to passing data back and forth between files. All of programming revolves around passing data to and from different places.`

##### Lessons

* Break up your lessons into different parts
* Make sure these parts `scaffold` one on top of the other
* Try to input very light "Five Minute Exercises" throughout your lessons
* This will help to keep students engaged and paying attention to the lesson at hand
* Utilize the `I do, You do` style of teaching

### Teaching Practices

* Engagement / Checks for Understanding
	* Work together on the white board
	* Fist of Five
	* Cupcakes / Bananas
* Never talk for an hour or more straight without having some form of activity / break in between
* Stay on track of the lesson plan. Do not go off topic. If a student ask a question that does not relate to the Learning Objectives shut it down (respectfully)
	* You can utilize a `Parking Lot` for this
		* Make a markdown and fill it with questions from the classroom that you did not know the answer to or did not want the answer to.
		* Example:
			* "Why doesn't this work with blah blah"
			* "Thats a great question, let's parking lot that for now so we can stay on task. I'll put something in the parking lot later today about it."
