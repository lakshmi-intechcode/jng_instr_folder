# Teaching Notes

* Lesson Plans
* Learning Objectives
	* Something that can be measured
	* No bullshit words such as "students will understand, students will learn"
	* Should be something tangible
		* "Students will be able to draw out an ERD"
		* "Students will be able to utilize a for loop and while loop"
* Context
	* Why are we learning what we are learning today? What is the purpose of today's lesson?
	* "We are learning about file I/O because passing data around is the core of what happens online. Whether it is happening only on our laptop, or through the browser, or a chat application. We are moving data around"
* Lessons	
	* Break it up into parts
	* You do, then they do
		* This can be difficult for such a short lecture
	* Try for very light and easy "Five Minute Exercises"
		* The goal is to get the students engaged, while keeping their minds on track with the lesson plan at hand
	* Engagement / Checks for understanding
		* Working together to write on the white board
		* Fist of Five
		* Cupcakes / Bananas
* Never talk for an hour or more straight without having some form of activity/break in between
* Stay on task
