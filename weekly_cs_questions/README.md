# Master List Of Questions For Monday Tech Talks

---

### Instructions

* If you are a TA managing this README please make sure to keep it updated every week with the new questions. 
* These questions are meant to cover programming topics that may or may not be in the Byte curriculum, but also serve as possible interview questions. 
* Every student will be given a question on Friday and they will have to present on that topic for five minutes on Monday morning.
* Please make sure to update the corresponding ***weekly_cs README*** for `EACH COHORT STUDENT REPOSITORY`
* All TA's are expected to coordinate with each other as to who will be updating each cohort repository, and who will be distributing the questions.
