#### Part 1 - What is MVC?

* The MVC concept is a popular design pattern meant to help programmers keep their code organized.
* There are three parts to this pattern
	* Models - Interact with your database
	* Views - Presents information to the end user
	* Controllers - Application Logic

***Why is this helpful? How is this more organized?***

* By following this pattern you will be able to search through, read, and edit your code much easier. 
* An added benefit to this patterns popularity is that collaboration between programmers will also be easier. 
* If you found an error in your code you will be able to locate it and debug it much faster. For example if the user sees something they are not supposed to see, you will check the "views" file first
* For the purposes of todays exercises we will be focusing strictly on the interaction between the Views and the Controllers.
