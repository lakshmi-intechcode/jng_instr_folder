# Culture Activities

### The Wind Blows For

* an activity where we're all in a circle, everybody is seated except for 1 person, they say "The Wind Blows For... people wearing jeans" everybody with jeans gets up and they have to rush to sit somewhere else. The last person standing follows with another wind blows for. 
	* This activity is fun, collaborative, makes everybody awake, and makes them comfortable with each other. 

### Bicycle (rusty on this detail)

* An example of how we are teaching them. Start by leading with abstractions. We are teaching you to teach yourself. There is a lot of material to cover in 3 months and we'll be using some technologies that have "magical" capabilities. You do not necessarily need to know what's under the hood. 
* A Bicycle was the example used by Sung "How many people can ride a Bike" "How many people knew how to build a bike before learning to ride a bike? 

### Different zones

* Best zone is the edge of the learning zone, if you are in the panic zone please let us know so we can help you. Open door policy

### Discomfort

* You need to be one with discomfort and frustration. Do not let it break you. Many times you may not understand something immediately, it will get better

### Marathon Everest Language

* How would you go about doing a marathon
* How would you go about climbing mount everest
* How would you go about learning a new language
* Break the students up into 3 or 6 groups and have them talk to each other about their category
* We come back to gether and we talk about:
	* Collaboration - if you are above somebody on the mountain you are still going to help them climb it, we are all trying to achieve the same goal
	* Training - nobody runs a marathon without any training. Slow and steady you will get better. Progress is not going to be as immediate or as fast as you expect
	* Learning how to program is like learning a new language - blah blah blah whatever you want to say here
	* There's also a slide that talks more about that stuff
* This will again make them talk to each other, force them to participate, then we come together to discuss how this immersive is going to be

### Positive vs Negative learning (forgot about this)

### Ground Rules - do we have any we want to talk about?

### Taking care of each other / Taking care of yourself

* flying V - the birds fly in that formation becaue the wind breaks and the gusts from their wings help the birds behind them
* Take care of yourself, don't stay up till 3 am every night, exercise, sleep, etc

### What makes a great developer / scope of knowledge

* You are going to learn so much in this course but it will be a tiny fraction of everything out there. You are going to learn how to self learn. 
* We can do the board activity where they all come up and write a bunch of dev buzzwords
* Then we circle only the ones we know and we tell them about how we have a combined 1034 years of exp and we still don't know everything. 

### Curriculum Overview

* Hand holding will go down as time moves on

### Checkins - we're doing it differently then diana and artemis
