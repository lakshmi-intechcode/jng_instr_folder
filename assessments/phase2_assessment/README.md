Phase 2 Assessment
================


For your assessment today we'll be building our own event management application. The requirements for this assignment are in the form of [user stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story). There is a lot of work here. DO NOT FREAK OUT. You will be assessed on the quality of your work, not the quantity. Plan what is needed to provide the experience for each User Story and execute it. Execute each user story sequentially from top to bottom.


Good luck and feel free to ask questions for clarity.


### Event Management 

Your program will contain users and events. Users can attend many events and an event can be attended by many users. Events are created by the user and thus belongs to the user. A user can create multiple events.


### User Stories:
* As a user, I can register for an account and sign in/out. (i.e. an account has a unique e-mail, password)
* As a user, I can create new events (Events have a title, description, location)
* As a user, I have a personal page that shows all the events that I've **created** and **attended**
* As a user, I can edit events
* As a user, I can destroy events
* As a user, I want to be able to add an event on the page that lists all my events. When that new event is created, it is appended to the list without the page refreshing.
* As a user, I would like a clean and approachable interface.
