# Binary Search Tree

#### Objectives

* You will make two classes: `TreeNode` and `Tree`
* `TreeNode` will be instantiated with a value as well as properties named left and right to hold other nodes
* `Tree will be instantiated with a root node
* You will create the following methods in your `Tree` class
	* `preorder`: this will traverse the tree and print every node's value
	* `search`: a recursive function that searches the tree for the value. Returns True if node exists, else returns False
	* `insert`: this should correctly insert a TreeNode in proper place (i.e.)
	* `inorder`: function that prints every node's value **in order** from lowest to highest
