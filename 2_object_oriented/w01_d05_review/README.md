# Week 1 Review Topics

#### Using Git (from your week 1 day 2 notes)

* Git is a collaboration tool that is universally used by programmers
* Below are the commands in git we will be using the most:
* `git init` - initialize a connection between that folder and git
* `git add` - show off your updates / differences between the repos
* `git commit -m "message here"` - add a message to this instance
* `git pull origin branch_name` - pull down the updates/changes from a repository
* `git push origin branch_name` - push up your changes to a repository
* `git checkout -b branch_name` - change to a different branch on your local machine, or create a new branch on your local machine
* `git status` - tells you what changes are in this folder and what branch you are on
* `git clone` - makes a copy of a targeted repo in a specified folder of your choice

***Notes***

* All of your daily repos will be done with branches

#### Mutable vs. Immutable
* Mutable = Can be changed / mutated
	* Lists
	* Dictionaries
* Immutable = Cannot be changed or mutated
	* Strings
	* Tuples
	
#### String Concatenation


* What does the word `concatenate` mean?
* What are the various ways to concatenate strings?

```
leo = "Leonardo"
raph = "Raphael"
mickey = "Michaelangelo"
donny = "Donnatello"

"The turtles, Leonardo, Raphael, Michaelangelo, Donnatello, are trained by their master Splinter; who was also mutated by the ooze."
```


#### Nested Data Structures

* What are nested data structures.
