# Measuring the Population

##### Description

* Okay so I couldn't find a easily downloadable file for fun data like movies or music, so we're going to stick with the population file from the lecture. For this assignment we will be using list comprehensions to complete all the iterating exercises. 
* We'll begin with some more easy list comprehensions then move towards importing and filtering through the csv file. 

***NOTE***

* Don't forget you have access to Pythons built in methods. (`sort`, `reverse`, and the like)


##### Objective 1

* Take an integer as an argument
* Return a list where all values are the even numbers up until the argument

##### Objective 2

* Take a string as an argument
* Return a list where all the values are the characters of the string in reverse

##### Objective 3 - From here on we'll be using the csv file

* How many people live in 'CA'
* How many people live in 'FL'
* How many people live in 'NJ'

##### Objective 4

* Take in two numbers between 1 and 100. How many people have an age between those given numbers
  
##### Objective 5

* Print out the ethnicities and the number of individuals for each ethnicity

##### Objective 6

* Print out the top 10 most populated states and their population, in order from largest to smallest
