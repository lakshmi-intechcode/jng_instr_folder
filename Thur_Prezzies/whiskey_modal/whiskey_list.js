		describe: "The finest bourbon in the world comes from a single barrel. That's the way Colonel Albert B. Blanton first bottled his private reserve bourbon nearly a century ago. Blanton believed the center-cut or middle sections of Warehouse H were the best for aging his bourbon. Personally tasting and choosing each barrel, these barrels were reserved and bottled for ambassadors, dignitaries, family and friends becoming the world's first single barrel bourbon. His time honored tradition lives on today as only a handful of barrels from the center of Warehouse H are selected to become Blanton's Single Barrel Bourbon.",

		heading: "Angels Envy",
		describe:"There’s bourbon. And then there’s divine inspiration painstakingly crafted into a spirit so sublime you’ll want to share it with the world. We make the second one. Angel’s Envy is what happens when 200 years of bourbon tradition meet an independent master craftsman’s instinct to improve. It’s a total return to the art of craft-first, hand blended batches of 8 to 12 barrels at a time.\n We personally taste every barrel throughout each step of the aging process to ensure that the spirits meet our perfectionist standards. This would be enough for any other premium bourbon, but we think you deserve more. That’s why we finish every one of our whiskeys in hand-selected finishing barrels. For an added layer of flavor and complexity, our bourbon and special cask strength are finished in ruby port casks, and our rye is finished in rum barrels. There’s no set time for this process. It’s only Angel’s Envy when we say it is.",

	hibiki: {
		heading: "Hibiki",
		describe: "Harmony - a rather apt word to describe this well-balanced Japanese blended whisky from the Hibiki range. Hibiki Japanese Harmony is made with malt whiskies from the Yamazaki and Hakushu distilleries, as well as grain whisky from the Chita distillery. The whiskies are drawn from 5 different types of cask, including American white oak casks, Sherry casks and Mizunara oak casks. The blend itself was crafted by the Suntory Whisky blending team, led by Master Blender Shingo Torii. An elegant expression, with wafts of honey, orange, a herbaceous touch or two and light oak.",

	hudson: {
		heading: "Hudson Bourbon",
		describe: "Hudson Baby Bourbon is the first legal pot-still whiskey to be produced in New York since prohibition! In the days before prohibition farm distillers could be found throughout the state of New York and Tuthilltown are doing their bit to put New York back on the whiskey map with this classic bourbon, full of caramel and sweet vanilla notes, it is made from 100% New York corn. Aged in tiny 2 gallon barrels, the spirit is 'sonically matured' with the help of bass speakers that agitate the cask and the liquid! Each bottle is then hand-filled, waxed and numbered, without the use of carbon or chill filtration.",

	woodford: {
		heading: "Woodford Reserve",
		describe: "The mashbill for Woodford Reserve features a high percentage of rye: 72% corn, 18% rye and 10% malt. Unusual also for being triple distilled and having the lowest proof upon entering the barrel where it matures for at least six years. A must have Kentucky bourbon. Makes a wonderful Old-Fashioned cocktail!",
