# STAR WARS BATTLES!!!Hero Battles

##### Objectives

* Your mission should you choose to accept it, is to use CSS positioning to position the star wars character images and pit them against one another. Remember we do not like using `float` or `position: absolute` because these take the element out of the `normal document flow`
* There should be three 
* Follow those images with rows of images where heroes face off against each other in a 1:1 battle. These must also have a centered `vs.` text between them
* You can pair up any two heroes you want to battle in the images folder
