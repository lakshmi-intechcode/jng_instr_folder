### Lesson

##### Part 1 - A brief history. Why is this important?

* It's not, well not the history at least. JavaScript is used as the main front end language for web development, and is not growing in popularity as a backend language. 
* JavaScript was created in 10 days in 1995. 
* It was use to build the front end of websites, how they looked, and what users can do with them. 
* It was not until recently JavaScript could be used as a backend language
* This occured with the emergence of Node JS. A runtime environment that allows programmers to build server-side applications in JavaScript
* This has gained traction as it is convenient to build a full web application, the front and back, in the same language
* JavaScript has been around a very long time and has a lot of documentation on it. Google ALL YOUR QUESTIONS!

##### Part 2 - Node REPL

* We will be installing Node JS to use it's REPL environment in the terminal
* This is the same as the Python environment except it takes Node syntax

##### Part 3 - JS Syntax / Data Types / Data Structures

* Variables
* Booleans
* Numbers - No Floats
* Arrays - Not List
* Objects - Not Dictionaries
* Strings - String concat all plus signs or commas. No .format

##### Part 4 - JS Syntax Control Flow / Iteration

* if / else if / else - Not elif
* Loops - For Loop While Loop
* Functions - var name = function(){}


***Five Min Exercise***

* Write an application that will loop through the following JS Object and console.log the keys into one array and the values in separate array

##### Part 5 - Process.ArgV
